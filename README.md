# Terrain-DiamondSquare
A 3D terrain in unity using the Diamond-Square algorithm

A 3D terrain in certain dimensional size is produced by the Diamond-Square algorithm which gets regeneratred by pressing the space key on a random basis. The terrain is also coloured based on different heights using a CG/HLSL shader. There is a water element present on the terrain which uses a shader to implement waves.
